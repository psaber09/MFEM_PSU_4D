# Block Solvers

The miniapp block-solvers compares the relative performance of some solvers for
the discrete saddle point problems arising from the mixed finite element
discretization of the second order scalar elliptic problem
                   -div(K grad p) = r.h.s.
The user can customize the problem settings by providing the mesh, the
coefficient K, and the essential/natural boundary assignment.

The discrete saddle point problem has a block structure of the form

                   [ M  B^T ] [u] = [g]
                   [ B   0  ] [p] = [f]

The solvers for the above block system include:

1. The divergence free solver (both coupled and decoupled modes).

   The idea of the solver is to exploit a multilevel decomposition of the
   Raviart-Thomas finite element space to find a particular flux solution
   satisfying the divergence constraint B u_p = f, and then solve the remaining
   divergence-free component of the flux u in the kernel space of the discrete
   divergence operator B. In our implementation, these two flux components and
   the pressure p can be solved one by one, or altogether simultaneously by
   switching the flag DFSParameters::coupled_solve (see div_free_solver.hpp).

   The multilevel decompositions of the Raviart-Thomas and discrete L2 space are
   given by DFSData, see the documentation in div_free_solver.hpp for more
   details. In block-solvers.cpp, the data are generated geometrically through
   mesh refinement and collection of "TransferOperators" of the spaces, This
   process is done in DFSSpaces. In general, the multilevel decompositions can
   also be obtained via element agglomeration (e.g., use ParElag).

2. MINRES preconditioned by a block diagonal preconditioner.

   This solver is the one used in examples/ex5p.cpp.

   First, define the approximate Schur complement S = B diag(M)^{-1} B^T. Then,
   BoomerAMG is used as a preconditioner for S, denoted by AMG(S). Lastly, the
   block diagonal preconditioner is defined as

             P^{-1} = [ diag(M)^{-1}     0    ]
                      [  0             AMG(S) ]
